# 🌱 Seeds of Peace (بذور السلام)

Seeds of Peace is an interactive idle/clicker web game aiming to combat violence, hatred, and extremism by symbolically planting "seeds" of peace, empathy, education, and dialogue.

### Vision 🌍

Each click symbolizes an act of peace, kindness, or positive dialogue, gradually transforming a barren landscape of conflict into a thriving garden of coexistence.

### Gameplay Mechanics 🎮

- **Click:** Plant a "Seed of Peace" that visually transforms the landscape.
- **Idle Actions:** Automate peace-building through symbolic characters (Teachers, Advocates, Artists).
- **Milestones:** Unlock educational content, real-world stories of peace, and conflict resolution inspiration.
- **Dynamic Background:** Starts in a blurred grayscale state and becomes clearer with each planted seed, celebrating milestones with a colorful flourish.

### Monetization Model 💰

- Ethical ads or sponsorships.
- Donations supporting NGOs fighting violence and promoting peace.
